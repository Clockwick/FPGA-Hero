        - generate the answer, just waiting for the correct incoming value from player
            -> searching for 2-bit operator on python
                -> generate 2 number (Summand, divider)
                    -> store its answer in var. waiting for correct incoming value
        - clear score section and blit over it
    2. Transition element
        - searching more information
    3. Get value from FPGA and mapping
